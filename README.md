# Computer-Vision-Projects
In this repo there are 3 projects that I have developed during the course "Computer Vision" using MATLAB.

## Project I
The purpose of this project is to create mosaic images (Figure 1). A mosaic image (called mosaic) is obtained by replacing the pixel blocks 
in a reference image with small images (we call them mosaic pieces) from a given collection of other images.
Replacing pixel blocks with pieces is done in such a way that the resulting mosaic can best approximate the reference image.
